<p>Thank you for your interest in Mozilla Clubs.</p>

<p>Your application to start a Mozilla Club has been denied. The following reasons may have contributed to this decision:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insufficient information on the application</li>
  <li>Topics/focus for the Club is unrelated to web literacy, digital inclusion/equity, working open, and/or 21st century skills</li>
  <li>Goals and processes do not align with <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/clubs/about">Mozilla Clubs values</a></li>
  <li>Reliance on financial assistance required on application</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many resources available to teach the web in your community outside of the Mozilla Clubs program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our open, free, hands-on <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/activities">curriculum for your Mozilla Club</a></li>
  <li>Our free, open source <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/tools">tools to learn coding in a really fun way</a></li>
  <li>Our free, interactive <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy">Web Literacy Map</a></li>
</ul>
